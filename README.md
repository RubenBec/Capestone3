Buying a house can be tricky. Not a lot of people know what goes into the price of a house. Underwriters know what they are looking for before they sign off on a loan, but the average person does not. I want to make a model that will accurately predict the price of a house. I will use Dean De Cock's Ames, Iowa dataset to train and test my model. There are over 68 features to work with and over 4,000 records in the dataset.
