Buying a house can be tricky. Not a lot of people know what goes into the price of a house. Underwriters know what they are looking for before they sign off on a loan, but the average person does not. I want to make a model that will accurately predict the price of a house. I will use Dean De Cock's Ames, Iowa dataset to train and test my model. There are over 68 features to work with and over 4,000 records in the dataset. The tools I will be using are Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn. If time permits, I would like to make a flask app that would allow a user to input the needed features and predict the price of a house, in Ames, Iowa.
