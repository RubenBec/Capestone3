## Background and Motivation

I love to try new resturants, but I never which ones to try. I often find myself reading reviews on yelp to help my decide, but sometimes I'll see reviews that that do not correspond with the rating they gave. A review will be mostly positive, but there will be one part of their experince that was not good and they'll give a 1 or 2 star review.
